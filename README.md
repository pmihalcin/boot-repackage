# boot-repackage
Sample project which would like to achieve the following:

* generate war and jar
* war will be deployed to external servlet container, such as tomcat or weblogic
* jar will be used to keep Intellij IDEA's Spring Boot run configuration working, even though we mark spring-boot-starter-tomcat as provided
